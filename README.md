# DeNoise - White Noise Application
DeNoise - White Noise Application for relaxation, studying or sleeping, made in Android Studio.

The application supports both **light and dark theme**, as well as **multiple languages**. Pleasently designed, it allows its users to listen to calming white/pink/brown noise sounds to relax, focus or help with sleep. A timer can be sey up, which will automatically turn off the sounds after the predetermined time has passed.

I plan on releasing this application on Play Store, as well as working on its expantion in forms of multiple new sounds (rain, beach, fireplace, etc.) and aditional custimization.
